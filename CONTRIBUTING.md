# How to contribute

Looking to contribute something to the toolset? **Here's how you can help.**

## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Pointshop core. Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** We get a lot of duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.**
3. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Pull requests

- Test your changes before hand, make sure they work with the provided test scenarios.
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small

## Coding standards
